These represent the total revenue generated from master package bookings and master event bookings, respectively, for that particular month.\n\nFor example, the first object in the list shows that in month 6 (June), the master package revenue was 487000.00, and the master event revenue was 0.00. Similarly, the second object shows that in month 3 (March), the master package revenue was 769000.00, and the master event revenue was 0.00.\n\nIt's worth noting that some months have multiple entries, which is because the revenue figures are split into master package revenue and master event revenue.
